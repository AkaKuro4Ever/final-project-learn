# README

Welcome to the Non-Instant Chat App, a React-Redux project! Here, you'll be able to communicate with others in a single-page application chatroom, using a Rails API Backend and React/Redux front-end.

To get started, clone the repo, and then run ```rake start```.

Be sure to sign-up and sign in. Just type in any name you'd like, and then type it again in the login text field. It's currently not designed to handle passwords or a lack of user before typing in a message (but no worries, the developer is well aware). Have fun and become as many different users as you'd like!


* Ruby version: 2.3.3, dependent on rack, rails, sqlite3, react-redux
